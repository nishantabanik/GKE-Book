# This configuration enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) for all services within the mesh, ensuring that all inter-service communication is encrypted and authenticated.

# Note: Ensure that all workloads have sidecar proxies injected to enforce mTLS effectively.

# For more information on configuring mTLS in Istio, refer to the official documentation: https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/
