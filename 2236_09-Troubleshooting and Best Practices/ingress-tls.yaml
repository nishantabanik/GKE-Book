# This Ingress resource routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic for example.com to the example-service on port 80. The TLS configuration references a Kubernetes Secret named example-tls that contains the SSL certificate and private key for example.com. Ensure that the example-tls Secret is created in the same namespace (default) as the Ingress resource.

# For more information on configuring Ingress with TLS in GKE, refer to the official documentation: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress-xlb
